Raspberry Pi 7" Touch Screen Display

Raspberry Pi uses a FT5406 attached to the VideoCore's I2C bus. The firmware
runs a thread that periodicaly does a register dump to a shared memory window.
The interrupt and wake signals seem disconnected.

Required properties:
 - compatible: "raspberrypi,raspberrypi-ft5406"
 - reg: address range of the shared memory with register dump

Example:

        touchscreen: rpi-ft5406@3e40ea40 {
                compatible = "raspberrypi,raspberrypi-ft5406";
                reg = <0x3e40ea40 63>;
        };
